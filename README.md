Python solutions to **<https://github.com/karan/Projects>**

This repo is mainly for learning purposes and just for fun. :smile:

Below is a list of projects that I've implemented and links to the solutions.

Classic Algorithms
------------------

[**Collatz Conjecture**](https://github.com/jnrbsn/python-projects/blob/master/classic_algorithms/collatz.py)
– Start with a number n > 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one
using the following process: If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply
it by 3 and add 1.

[**Sieve of Eratosthenes**](https://github.com/jnrbsn/python-projects/blob/master/classic_algorithms/eratosthenes.py)
– The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the
smaller primes (below 10 million or so).

Numbers
-------

[**Find PI to the Nth Digit**](https://github.com/jnrbsn/python-projects/blob/master/numbers/pi.py)
– Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal
places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

Web
---

[**Fetch Current Weather**](https://github.com/jnrbsn/python-projects/tree/master/web/weather)
– Get the current weather for a given zip/postal code.
